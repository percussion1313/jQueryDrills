Simple jQuery Drills
Objective
Practice using the fundamentals of jQuery that were explored in lecture.

Setup
Create a new project folder and connect it to a GitHub repository. Initialize your project with a README with a brief description of the purpose of this assignment, along with the title "jQuery Drills".
Create an index.html file and an app.js file and link the two together.
Create a script tag in the index.html and link to the jQuery CDN.
Tasks
In app.js, make sure all the HTML has loaded before using jQuery.
Create an input with an id in the index.html called "Submit".
In app.js select the element by the id and add a click event that will alert a message in the browser when the button is clicked.
In the index.html, create a form element with an input field and the button you created. Add a type attribute to the button and assign it to "submit".
In app.js when the form is submitted, alert the value of the text input field.
If the user has typed in the input field then the button should be enabled, otherwise the button should be disabled.
Create a div element and append it to the body.
When the user types in the input field and clicks submit, append the text in an h2 element to the div
When the user mouses over the h2 element, assign it a new background color and border radius.
Great job! Now, delete the code for creating the h2 and we are going to work on creating a list
Create an unordered list and append it to the body
When the user submits the form, append the text as list item to the unordered list
When the user clicks on the li element, assign it a random color.
When the user double clicks on the list, remove the item that was clicked on.
